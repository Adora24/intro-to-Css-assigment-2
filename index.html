      <h2>Why i Love Technology</h2>

      <p>
        <b><i>Technology</i></b> can be said to be basically application of
        information for the building and development of devices and equipment
        that can be used in a lot of different ways. Today,
        <b><i>technology</i></b> is now a very integral part of the day-to-day
        life for each and every one of us. Even though
        <b><i>technology</i></b> has gone a very long way in making life more
        convenient for every one of us, <b><i>technology</i></b> has also
        brought along a variety of negative effects that we cannot overlook. 

        <p>Reasons for loving <b><i>technology</i></b> is because all of the things that we make use of daily including internet connection,
        lamps, cars, air conditioners, phones, laptops, bikes, refrigerators and
        even gas stoves are all products of <b><i>technology</i></b>. <b><i>Technology</i></b> has made our
        life easier and smoother. We can get everything just by a single click
        of our fingers.</p>

        <h1> Important of Css</h1>
        <p><b><i>CSS</i></b> stands for cascading style sheets.
           In short, <b><i>CSS</i></b> is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. 
           Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, <b><i>CSS</i></b> determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. <b><i>HTML</i></b> is a markup language, and <b><i>CSS</i></b> is a style sheet language. 
           Think “look and feel” when you think CSS.
           <p>
            If <b><i>HTML</i></b> were the engine components of a car, 
            <b><i>CSS</i></b> would be the body style and the paint job. A website can run without CSS, but it certainly isn't pretty. 
            <b><i>CSS</i></b> makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format,
            <b><i>CSS</i></b> is responsible for font color and more.

           <p><b><i>Border</i></b> - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above.</p>  
            <p><b><i>Margin</i></b> - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.</p>
